# Binary release

This is a binary version of the fertilized forests library.
You can use it in the canonical way, i.e., include the `include` folder,
link against files in the `lib` folder and use the .dll files in the
`bin` folder.

This build comes with a Python version in the `pyfertilized` folder.
It is portable. If you want to install lit to your local Python installation,
cd into the `pyfertilized` folder and run `python setup.py install`.
